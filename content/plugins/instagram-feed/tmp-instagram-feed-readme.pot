"<strong>Great plugin with great support and service By northguide, September 21, 2015 for WP 4.3.1</strong>\n"
"I've deployed many wordpress plugins over the years and this plugin is easily one of the best. The installation was flawless. I was able to set up my instagram feeds in minutes and able to get the look I wanted using the options in the short code with only a few, minor tweakings. I had some questions about additional capabilities and was impressed how quickly I support got back to me with some solutions. Solid performance in all aspects so far. Never been happier with a plugin purchase."
