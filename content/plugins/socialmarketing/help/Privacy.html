            FarReach.es <em>Plugin and Service</em>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Social Marketing Plugin ("Plugin") available at <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/socialmarketing/">http://wordpress.org/plugins/socialmarketing/</a>
            collects and transmits to the FarReach.es ("Service") information that you supply and from your
            WordPress configuration. This information includes:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your site's Authors, Editors and Administrators.
                <ul>
                    <li>This information is used to attribute content authorship and who published the content.</li>
                    <li>Synchronized security - if you add/remove a user's access to your website - the Plugin communicates
                        that security change to the Service</li>
                    <li>Technical errors that require contacting you or the affected user</li>
                    <li>Marketing additional services to your designated Marketing person</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Published Posts: Absense of bugs, the Plugin transmits to the FarReach.es Service,
                only published, non-password-protected, public posts in categories marked as to be sent to social media sites.
                Posts that were previously transmitted that then are recategorized, trashed, or rendered not visible to the
                general public have their id transmitted (but not their content) to the Service so that the Service no longer
                publicizes that post.</li>
            <li>WordPress Categories: The Service routes content based on your categories so category information is
                necessary for that process to function</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The FarReach.es Service ("Service") accesses your social media sites for the sole purpose of
            publishing content that has been explicitly authorized by your staff. The Service does not access any of your
            contacts, address book or connections.</p>
        <p>Your Website Visitor Privacy: The Plugin does NOT collect any information about your site's web visitors.</p>
        <h3>
            FarReach.es <em>website</em>
        </h3>
        <p>Like most website operators, FarReach.es collects non-personally-identifying information of
            the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
            referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. FarReach.es's purpose in
            collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how FarReach.es's
            visitors use its website. From time to time, FarReach.es may release non-personally-identifying
            information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

        <p>FarReach.es also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
            Protocol (IP) addresses. FarReach.es does not use such information to identify its visitors,
            however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
            personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

        <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>Certain visitors to FarReach.es's websites choose to interact with
            FarReach.es in ways that require FarReach.es to gather
            personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that FarReach.es gathers
            depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and
            email address. In each case, FarReach.es collects such information only insofar as is necessary
            or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with FarReach.es.
            FarReach.es does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
            And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them
            from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

        <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
        <p>FarReach.es may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. However,
            FarReach.es does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

        <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>FarReach.es discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
            information in order to process it on FarReach.es's behalf or to provide services available at
            FarReach.es's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
            employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using
            FarReach.es's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
            FarReach.es will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
            information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above,
            FarReach.es discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
            only when required to do so by law, or when FarReach.es believes in good faith that disclosure
            is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of FarReach.es, third parties, or the
            public at large. If you are a registered user of a FarReach.es website and have supplied your
            email address, FarReach.es may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
            solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with FarReach.es and
            our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of
            email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
            we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
            users. FarReach.es takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized
            access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser
            provides to the website each time the visitor returns. FarReach.es uses cookies to help
            FarReach.es identify and track visitors, their usage of FarReach.es
            website, and their website access preferences. FarReach.es visitors who do not wish to have
            cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
            FarReach.es's websites, with the drawback that certain features of
            FarReach.es's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

        <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, FarReach.es may change its Privacy Policy from
            time to time, and in FarReach.es's sole discretion. FarReach.es
            encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this
            site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
