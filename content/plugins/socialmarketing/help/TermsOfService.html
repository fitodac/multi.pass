                We would <strong>love</strong> for you to use it. Our service is designed to help you market on social media
                sites. We wish to encourage you to express yourself freely. However, be responsible in what you spread. In
                particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items listed in (<a href="#responsibility_of_contributors">Responsibility
                    of Contributors</a>) appear in your messages or get linked to from your messages (things like spam, viruses, or
                hate content).

                    href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/socialmarketing/">WordPress plugin</a> (taken together, the Service). The
                Service is owned and operated by Amplafi, Inc. ("Company"). The Service is offered subject to your
                acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules,
                policies (including, without limitation, <a href="http://FarReach.es/Privacy.html">Amplafi, Inc.'s
                    Privacy Policy</a>) and procedures that may be published from time to time on our <a
                    href="http://FarReach.es/">corporate site</a> by Amplafi, Inc. (collectively, the
                "Agreement").
            </p>
            <p>Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Service. By accessing or using any part of
                the Service, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all
                the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the Service or use any services. If these
                terms and conditions are considered an offer by Amplafi, Inc., acceptance is expressly limited to
                these terms. The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old.</p>
            <ol>

                <li><strong>Your Social Marketing Account and Security</strong> If you create an account on
                    the Service, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible
                    for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the account.
                    You must not describe or assign keywords to your messages in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a
                    manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others, and Amplafi, Inc. may change or
                    remove any description or keyword that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause
                    Amplafi, Inc. liability.
                    <p class="important">You must immediately notify Amplafi, Inc. of any unauthorized uses of
                        your account or any other breaches of security. Amplafi, Inc. will not be liable for any acts
                        or omissions by You, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.</p>
                    <p class="important">The Service relies on you maintaining your WordPress site's user accounts. Access to
                        your account on the Service is exclusively through the Plugin. The Plugin will automatically synchronize
                        any changes in the WordPress user accounts with the Service. Because the world is imperfect, this
                        automatic synchronization can fail due to a variety of reasons. We have created a number of security
                        measures to reduce the possibility of unauthorized use of your account, however, you are the first line of
                        defense.</p></li>
