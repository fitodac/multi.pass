<br><h3> Suggestions/Complaints/Requests </h3><br>
<br>We regard user confusion as a bug. 
<br>
<br>If you find any part of the product confusing or frustrating - please let us know. In particular for text or error messages if you have a suggested alternative we would love your suggestion.
<br>
<br>Complaints about confusion are treated seriously and are not ignored.
<br>
<br><h3> Feature suggestions </h3><br>
<br>If you have a feature suggestion we would love to hear it as well.
<br>We can't promise that we will implement the feature - but we will respond to you.
<br>
<br>When sending a feature suggestion please:
<br>
<br><ol><li> A brief description of your business problem the feature helps solve. </li>
<br><li> A 'Use Case' - briefly explaining how you would use the feature.</li>
<br><li> How valuable is this feature - and yes we do mean money. We need to rank features in order of implemention. We need to pay mortgages and feed our kids. If the requestor volunteers to pay for the feature, that tells us we are not wasting our time.  </li>
<br>
</ol><br>We will be offering paid features soon. Not every feature will be available for free. If a feature is suggested that ends up being a paid feature, the first suggestors will be offered an opportunity to test out the feature for free. A discount may also be offered. We are working out details, so this is not a commitment
<br>
<br><h3> Which Posts are sent to the FarReach.es service? </h3><br>
<br>Only published posts in categories assigned to social marketing sites are sent to the web service for distribution to your social marketing sites.
<br>
<br><h3> Multi-site WordPress </h3><br>
<br>Not supported at this time.
<br>
<br><h3> Plugin fails to install </h3><br>
<br><ol><li> Make sure that WordPress is installed at an URL that is publicly visible. For example, if WordPress has its site as "localhost" the plugin will not work because the FarReach.es cannot contact the plugin. </li>
<br>
</ol><br><h3> Content is not published on Facebook, twitter, et. al. </h3><br>
<br><ol><li> Make sure that the Facebook Pages, Twitter, and  Tumblr accounts have been assigned at least one category.</li>
<br><li> Make sure that Facebook, et.al. allows the FarReach.es application to access your account.</li>
<br><li> Social Marketing does not work with auto reposting plugins. These are plugins such as wp-robot that bring in content from other websites and repost it. This is intentional and will not be "fixed" (at least in the free version):</li>
<br>   <li> Facebook and Twitter frown on duplicate content and treat our service as a spammy service if it posts duplicate (spammy) content. This creates work on our part.</li>
<br>   <li> Dealing with Facebook and Twitter issues are costly.</li>
<br>   <li> We will create a version of the plugin that works with auto reposter plugins but that will be at a cost. (since facebook esp. will have issues).</li>
<br>
</ol><br>
<br><h3> Something Else? </h3><br>
<br><ol><li> Contact us at feedback@FarReach.es</li>
<br><li> Include your name and contact information ( sometimes a phone/skype conversation is easier / faster than emails ).</li>
<br><li> Timezone and times that are good to call you.</li>
<br><li> Your web site url ( so we can look up your account ) </li>
