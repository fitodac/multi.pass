# Avatars

## Installing for the first time

* `npm install` will download all dependencies

## Releasing
`npm run build` will create a new folder called `build` that contains:

* The plugin folder with just the files needed to make the plugin work.
* The zip file for that version (which you need to upload to the project page in WPMU DEV)
 
Remember to sync the plugin version with the one in `package.json` before releasing.
